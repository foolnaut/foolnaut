## Wallets
Wallets are secure custodians for your private key. Ensure your wallet is password protected and only use open-source wallets.

#### Public Key
- You can share your public address with anyone.

#### Private Key
- This is your password allowing you to access your funds.
- Do **NOT** share this with anyone you don't trust.

#### Mnemonic Phrase
- Human-readable private key equivalent. Typically made up of 12 or 24 English words.
- Also referred to as "seed phrase" or "secret recovery phrase".
- Generated automatically through the [BIP-39 specification](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).
- You can import either your mnemonic or private key to any supported wallet. (You cannot import a Bitcoin mnemonic into Keplr but you can import a Cosmos mnemonic into Keplr, Cosmostation, or any other supported wallet.)
