#### Why the Cosmos ecosystem? 💜
After extensive research, foolnaut believes the Cosmos ecosystem is the best fit for developing and supporting application-specific blockchains. The Cosmos ecosystem, or "the Internet of Blockchains", has been in constant development since 2016 and has proven to be useful and valuable.

foolnaut believes there is great hope for the Cosmos ecosystem to transform the world due to its brilliant design, altruistic culture, and native interoperability.

If another blockchain ecosystem comes along and proves with evidence that they are unequivocally better than the Cosmos ecosystem long-term, for using, connecting, and building application-specific blockchains, as well as sufficiently adhering to altruistic ideals and decentralization, foolnaut will not hesitate to change his mind. 🙏
