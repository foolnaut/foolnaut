**Lesson 1**

## Blockchains

Blockchains are communication protocols using principles of cryptography, math, logging, and synchronization.

#### Decentralized Systems

-   More robust because they are distributed to the people instead of one team.

## 1st-Gen Blockchains

_(Bitcoin, Doge, etc.)_

-   Gives us
    -   Transactions with number & text
-   Solved Problems
    -   Censorship Resistance
    -   Data Immutability
-   New Problem
    -   Scalability

## 2nd-Gen Blockchains

_(Ethereum, Solana, EOS, Tron)_

-   Gives us
    -   Transactions with number & code
    -   Smart contracts, tokenization, NFTs, DeFi, DAOs, DEXes
-   Solved Problems
    -   Scalability
-   New Problem
    -   Interoperability

## 3rd-Gen Blockchains

_(**Tenderment [Cosmos]**, Substrate [Polkadot, KSM])_

-   Gives us
    -   Transactions between blockchains
    -   Accessable governance
    -   The Interchain
    -   Liquid Staking
    -   "The Internet of Blockchains"
-   Solved Problems
    -   Interoperability
-   New Problems
    -   ???? (Possibly further decentralization)

#### Cosmos SDK (Software Developer Kit)

-   <https://docs.cosmos.network/>
-   Cosmos SDK makes the process for building application-specific blockchains easy.  

#### IBC-Protocol (Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol)

-   <https://ibcprotocol.org/>
-   IBC is an interoperability protocol for communicating arbitrary data between arbitrary state machines.
-   For example, it is used to send ATOM from the Cosmos Hub to the Osmosis blockchain. No [wrapped/synthetic](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin) ATOM needed.

#### Map of Zones

-   <https://mapofzones.com>
-   View more than 30 blockchains all connected via IBC protocol.

#### What is an ecosystem made of?

-   Tools & dApps, Backend, Frontend, Social Media
